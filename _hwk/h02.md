The goal of the homework is to change `initCoord` and `initBox` to use pass-by-reference (see Lec 10 notes) instead of pointers. We recommend doing this homework first before tackling the lab, since this will allow you to focus on implementing the logic and functionality of the Lab05, without getting lost on the syntax. Note: there is no need for `*b` or `*coord` or `->` when passing the struct by reference.

Create a new repo called `hw02_<username>`. Make sure the repo is PRIVATE.

Use the same starter files as for Lab05.
